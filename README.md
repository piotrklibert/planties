# PLANTies

### Why? ###

I started growing some plants lately, and around the sime time I also bought
Raspberry Pi. I realized that it would be a fun project to try and automate
plant care so I tried doing that.


### What? ###

PLANTies is an Elixir application meant to be run on the Pi. It is capable of:

- switching on/off 4 independent Relays
- reading a temperature using an external thermometer connected via `w1`
- reading key-presses from attached, 4-keys keypad
- reacting to button presses on an IR pilot
- reading the soil humidity value
- beep a buzzer
- blink a diode
